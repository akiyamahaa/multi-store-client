# Mini Supermarket Management System Project

## Objective
This project is developed to provide a comprehensive management solution that helps mini-supermarkets optimize sales processes, manage inventory, and improve customer service. The system not only supports detailed management of order information, products, and inventory but also provides useful business reports to help managers make informed decisions.

## Main Features

- **Order Management**:  
  The system allows tracking of order status from the moment an order is placed until the product is delivered. Managers can view detailed order information (customer name, delivery address, order time, status). This feature helps optimize the delivery process and ensures customer satisfaction.
  
- **Product Management**:  
  Easily manage the product catalog, including origin and product categories. Managers can add, edit, or delete product information, making it quick and intuitive to update details.
  
- **Inventory Management**:  
  The system automatically updates inventory levels after each transaction. When stock levels fall below the minimum threshold, the system will send an alert to prompt restocking. Information such as prices, suppliers, and expiration dates are also stored and easily accessible.

- **Reporting and Analysis**:  
  Provides detailed reports on revenue, profits, and consumption trends. The analysis tools help identify shopping patterns and support more effective business strategies and promotions.

- **User-Friendly Interface**:  
  The system is designed with a simple and easy-to-use interface for both managers and customers. The intuitive layout enhances the user experience by making it easy to find information and perform necessary actions.
